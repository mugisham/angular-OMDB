This simple app uses angularjs, ui-router, ngResource, toastr, fontawesome and bootstrap for the front end. The backend data about the movies comes from http://www.omdbapi.com/

In the application, you can search by movie title which brings a paginated list of possible matches or type the exact IMDb id to get that 
particular movie you are searching for. every movie selectted will be added to your history list and every movie you like will be added to the liked list.
This two lists are however not persisted.
